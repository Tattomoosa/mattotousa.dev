I've been playing with a new generic pattern in Unity that I'm quite happy with.

Essentially, the idea is collections that create,
activate and deactivate, and destroy game objects.

The simplest use, one I haven't bothered to implement yet, is the humble List.

```c#

```

Not the most interesting thing in the world
