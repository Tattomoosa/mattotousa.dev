So I just got a Master's degree last week.
Well.. over the course of a couple years I guess. But I did receive it last week...
Okay so I technically received the diploma today. You know what I mean.

_It feels good!_

And it was good --
I got to work on a lot of really cool projects and I met a bunch of really great people.
And yet, I just don't feel like a _master_.

<!-- more -->

It actually seems kind of insulting on its face to me, the idea that you can do a thing
for a couple <comment>(ok, _several_)</comment> years and be a _master_.
I don't know if I believe most PhD's running around out there doing their PhD things are _masters_ either though,
so maybe I'm just putting too much stock in the word.

I certainly do feel _capable_.

Like I could tackle whatever programming task was put in front of me.
Like I'm proficient with enough tools in enough problem domains to kind of do whatever I gotta do.
But that's not like, oh let me just whip out `<project>`, fully formed, straight out of my brain.
That's like, I could wrestle with that task, get frustrated with that task,
make breakthroughs towards that task, and eventually come out on top.
But that doesn't seem like _mastery_ to me.
But I also didn't just get my Capable's, so maybe that's just how it is.

I'm certainly comfortable calling myself a _Software Engineer_ (see above),
or a _Full Stack Developer_. I called myself a _Front End Developer_ with only
a certificate from a free online academy to my name.
(Which I still stand by! [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) was a _fantastic_ way to get started, I just found I wanted to go deeper)
But these terms only say "Oh yeah, I can do _that thing_" -- they don't exactly imply to me
that I can swim through the code like water the way a _master_ should.
This is probably just me having unrealistic expectations.

I mean, Computer Science is huge.
No one can really hope to know it all.
Even though, that said, _damn_, wouldn't it be cool if you could?

Programming, like many other disciplines, means standing on the shoulders of giants.
But here, we're literally running heaps and heaps of code written by the very hands of those giants.
And honestly, one of the most important things I got out of my education was actually
how much I need to work on becoming comfortable with how much I _don't_ know,
and focus on the task at hand.

I used to spend long hours writing code.
These days, as a _master_, I feel like I spend significantly more hours reading documentation.
The actual writing of the code, by the time it comes down to it, tends to go relatively fast
barring the occasional bugs.
But this change has more to do with my reluctance as a beginner to use libraries than any sort
of mastery over the domain of code itself.

Because as a beginner I thought if I just understood enough, then I'd be _good_.
10x programmer material or whatever. A _master_.
That writing everything with only the standard library to depend on was teaching me, little by little, everything.
This was, shockingly, a dead end.
So I thought I hit a wall, and needed an instructor, to understand it all,
and I went to school.
I didn't understand then,
and I wouldn't understand for at least a year,
that I simply couldn't hope to know everything, and I never would.

The human brain simply isn't that big.

So, in some ways I feel like I've grown tremendously, while in others I feel like
I haven't grown at all.
Some of my projects before I landed in school still feel more impressive than
some of the things I've done lately -- even though I know behind the scenes
they're essentially tied together with
duct tape, ready to break if you look at them wrong.

I think in some ways this was school limiting my scope often to only a couple weeks
for a thing,
not to mention needing to juggle that and work making it difficult to even think about
doing longer term projects.

But I do wonder if it also has something to do with just _jumping in_ and _doing something_
instead of poking around and reading docs and wondering which language or library will really make it easy.
