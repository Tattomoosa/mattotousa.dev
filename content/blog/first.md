So I just got a Master's degree last week.
It feels good to be done.
I got to work on a lot of really cool projects and I met a bunch of really great people.
But I don't feel like a *master*, by any means.

I mean, Computer Science is huge.
No one can really hope to know it all.
Even in a relatively tiny domain --
think not "Web development" but smaller,
maybe "Web accessibility",
or maybe that's too large still.

But programming, like many other disciplines, means standing on the shoulders of giants.
And honestly, one of the most important things I got out of my education was actually
becoming much more comfortable with how much I *don't* know.

<!-- more -->

I used to spend long hours writing code.
These days, as a *master*, I feel like I spend more hours reading documentation.
The actual writing of the code, by the time I have a plan and understand how my dependencies work,
tends to go extremely fast.
But this change has more to do with my reluctance as a beginner to use libraries than any sort
of mastery over the domain of code itself.

Because as a beginner I thought if I just understood enough, then I'd be *good*.
10x programmer material or whatever.
That writing everything with only the standard library to depend on was teaching me, little by little, everything.
This was, shockingly, a dead end.
So I thought I hit a wall, and needed an instructor, to understand it all,
and I went to school.
I didn't understand then,
and I wouldn't understand for at least a year,
that I simply couldn't hope to know everything, and I never would.

The human brain simply isn't that big.

So, in some ways I feel like I've grown tremendously, while in others I feel like
I haven't grown at all.
Some of my projects before I landed in school still feel more impressive than
some of the things I've done lately -- even though I know they're only tied together with
duct tape and good luck.

I think in some ways this was school limiting my scope often to only a couple weeks
for a thing,
not to mention needing to juggle that and work making it difficult to even think about
doing longer term projects.
But I do wonder if it also has something to do with just *jumping in* and *doing something*
instead of poking around and wondering which language or library will really make it easy.

This site is a good example of this. I made very simple sites in
