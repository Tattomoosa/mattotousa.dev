An implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
in React, completed as part of my FreeCodeCamp front end developer certification.

It performed better than most submissions to the project, but
obviously quite a bit worse than much more efficient GPU implementations.

React was a requirement for the project,
but since it's printing to canvas React really isn't that well utilized.
As with my maze generator, it would be nice to go back and rip React out and
let it stand alone as a 'vanilla' JS demonstration.
