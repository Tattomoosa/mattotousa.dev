An implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
in React, completed as part of my FreeCodeCamp front end developer certification.

It performed better than most submissions to the project (that I found), but
obviously quite a bit worse than much more efficient GPU implementations.
