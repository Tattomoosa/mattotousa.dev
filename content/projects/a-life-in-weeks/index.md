Inspired by
[a post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)
on the blog
[Wait but Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/),
this is a website that fills out a table representing every week
"in your life" (up to a user-configurable life expectancy)
where the filled in cells represent the weeks already passed,
and the empty cells those yet to come.

This was one of my first-ever completed web projects, and I'm pleasantly surprised
that it isn't completely terrible.
There are of course plenty of things I would do differently now,
but overall it more or less holds up.

What I'm _not_ pleasantly surprised about is how many more boxes are filled in now
than were when I first built this in 2016.
