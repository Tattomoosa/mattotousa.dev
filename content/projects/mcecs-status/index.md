The MCECS Status Page is a real-time status dashboard showing the current status of servers and
services in the Portland State University Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science.

This page allows users to check whether or not they're on the PSU network,
which servers are currently down, and several stats about the device the user
is visiting the page from.
