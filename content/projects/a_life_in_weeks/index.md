Inspired by the blog [Wait but Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/),
this is a website that fills out a table representing every week
"in your life" -- up to a user-configurable life expectancy --
where the filled in cells represent the weeks already passed,
and the empty cells those yet to come.

This was one of my first-ever completed web projects, and I'm pleasantly surprised that it still works correctly.
There are of course things I would do differently now (e.g. the styling is a bit much)
but overall it more or less holds up.
