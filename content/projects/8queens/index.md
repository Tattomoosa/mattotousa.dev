This is a genetic algorithm that finds a winning solution to the "8 queens"
problem.
This problem entails placing 8 queens on a chess board such that if any were to
move, they couldn't capture any of the others.
This implementation is in Python with no dependencies.

Completed as part of CS 541: Artificial Intelligence at Portland State University.
It doesn't perform as well as I'd hoped,
but it was one of the higher performing implementations from the class.
