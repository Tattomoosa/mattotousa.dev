Inception! That's this site!

So -- I have a history of making highly complicated Portfolio sites, loaded up with
React and animations and fancy nonsense.
I decided the time for all that was over.

I'm using the fantastic [Zola Static Site Generator](https://www.getzola.org/).
It uses the Tera templating engine for templates.

Both Zola and Tera are pure Rust, and damn they are _fast_.
Zola generates this entire site in milliseconds _I love it_.
